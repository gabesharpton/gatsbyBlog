title: "My personal reflection after completing a coding boot camp"
---

I graduated from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) Software Engineer Immersive Program this week. And there is a lot of mixed emotions I have now that it is done. First off I would like to say that attending the boot camp was the best decision I have made for my career. I have worked in multiple different industries before trying to tackle the world of development. And while I was able to learn a lot on my own, attending the boot camp really gave me the direction and discipline to continue being successful on my own.

There is an entire world that has just opened up for me and the skill to pick up a new language and build a simple app in just a few weeks is a skill I will cherish for the rest of my life. I did not expect my culinary skills to be so transferable to software development, but I constantly find myself using the skills I learned in a kitchen to problem solve problems in my apps. I loved figuring out different techniques and which ingredients I could use to improve a dish and now I love figuring out different ways to write an app to improve performance and overall design. The first project I will learn on my own will be a basic blog app in Vue.js and the same app in React.

I am also excited to learn about things like Gatsby and CSS libraries like LESS and SASS. These are all things they did not teach us about in the boot camp, but I do not know if I would have been motivated to learn them without the discipline it gave me. And there is so much more out there I can not wait to find out about!
